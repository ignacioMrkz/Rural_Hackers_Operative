# 🌾 Rural Hackers OS

**Rural Hackers OS** is a retro-inspired digital playground built to empower rural communities through creativity, technology, and collaboration. Designed with an 8-bit soul and a hacker mindset, this open-source platform is part game, part learning space, and part movement.

## 🎯 What is this?

Rural Hackers OS is a web-based environment that simulates an old-school operating system — but with a twist. Every window, every command, every folder is a portal to stories, tools, and actions related to rural innovation.

It includes:

- 🖥️ A retro-style interactive interface
- 🌍 A Galician-inspired empowerment game
- 🔧 Modules for collaborative learning, creativity, and local impact
- 💬 Messages, secrets, and Easter eggs hidden across the experience
